# Caesar Cipher Encryption (Python)

A Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption system built in Python, developed as part of the MITx 6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python course on edX.

## 🔐 Project Overview

This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique, which shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## 🛠️ Features

- Custom shift encryption
- Decryption support
- Maintains punctuation and spaces
- Object-oriented design (class-based)

## 📚 What I Learned

- String manipulation
- Dictionaries and loops
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python
- Writing modular and reusable code
